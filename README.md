# Neuralink Implant Challenge — Solution

A small repo showing how I reconstructed a handwritten phrase from mouse **velocities** sampled every **15 ms** and verified the result with the provided checker.

## Challenge Summary

- Given:
  - `mouse_recorder.py` — logs mouse movement deltas every 0.015s
  - `mouse_velocities.csv` — captured deltas (`velocity_x`, `velocity_y`)
  - `check_answer.py` — verifies the decoded phrase
- Goal: Reconstruct the path from velocities, read the phrase, and verify it.

## Repository Contents

- `mouse_recorder.py` — original recorder (for reference)
- `mouse_velocities.csv` — provided challenge data
- `check_answer.py` — hash checker for your guess
- `reconstruct_path.py` — integrates velocities and plots the trajectory
- `positions.csv` — integrated path (x, y) generated by the script
- `trajectory_y_down.png` / `trajectory_y_up.png` — plots of the reconstructed path
- `README_SOLVE_STEPS.md` — brief write-up of approach
- `answer.txt` — final uppercase answer (one line)

## Quick Start

```bash
# (optional) set up a venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# reconstruct and plot
python reconstruct_path.py
# -> writes positions.csv, trajectory_y_down.png, trajectory_y_up.png
